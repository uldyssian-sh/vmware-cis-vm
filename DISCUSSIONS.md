# Discussion Topics for VMware CIS VM Hardening

## Security Implementation

**Q: Production deployment considerations**
Planning to implement CIS hardening across 500+ VMs. What's your approach for phased rollout and testing? Any gotchas with specific applications?

**Q: Compliance validation**
How do you validate ongoing compliance after initial hardening? Looking for automated scanning and reporting solutions.

## Configuration Management

**Q: Ansible vs PowerShell DSC**
Comparing automation approaches for CIS compliance. Anyone using Ansible for VMware VM hardening instead of PowerShell? Pros and cons?

**Q: Custom baseline modifications**
Need to modify some CIS controls for legacy applications. What's the best practice for documenting and managing custom baselines?

## Integration & Automation

**Q: CI/CD pipeline integration**
How do you integrate CIS hardening into your VM provisioning pipeline? Looking for examples of automated compliance checking.

**Q: vRealize Automation integration**
Anyone integrating this with vRA blueprints? Want to ensure new VMs are hardened automatically during deployment.

## Monitoring & Maintenance

**Q: Drift detection strategies**
What tools do you use to detect configuration drift from CIS baseline? Need something that can scale across large environments.

**Q: Patch management impact**
How do you handle Windows updates that might revert CIS configurations? Any specific monitoring for post-patch compliance?

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Application compatibility issues**
Experiencing issues with legacy applications after CIS hardening. What's your approach for identifying and resolving compatibility problems?

**Q: Performance impact assessment**
Has anyone measured the performance impact of full CIS implementation? Particularly interested in I/O intensive workloads.

## Specific Controls

**Q: User Account Control settings**
The UAC settings in the baseline seem very restrictive for our environment. Anyone found a good balance between security and usability?

**Q: Network security configurations**
Questions about the firewall rules in the CIS baseline. Some seem to conflict with our monitoring tools. How do you handle exceptions?

## Audit & Reporting

**Q: Compliance reporting automation**
Need to generate monthly compliance reports for auditors. What tools or scripts do you use for automated CIS compliance reporting?

**Q: Evidence collection**
What's your process for collecting and maintaining evidence of CIS compliance for audit purposes? Looking for efficient documentation strategies.

## Best Practices

**Tip: Staged implementation**
Found that implementing CIS controls in phases works better than all-at-once. Start with low-risk controls and gradually increase security posture.

**Tip: Testing methodology**
Always test CIS configurations in isolated environment first. Some controls can break applications in unexpected ways.
