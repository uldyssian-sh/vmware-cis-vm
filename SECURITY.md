## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use the "Report a vulnerability" button in the Security tab
2. **Email**: Send details to the repository maintainers (check repository settings for contact info)

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Type of issue** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- **Full paths of source file(s)** related to the manifestation of the issue
- **The location of the affected source code** (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Any special configuration** required to reproduce the issue
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact of the issue**, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours of receiving the report
- **Status Update**: Within 72 hours with an assessment of the report
- **Resolution**: Security fixes will be prioritized and released as soon as possible

## Security Considerations

### Script Security

This PowerShell script interacts with VMware vSphere infrastructure. Please consider the following security aspects:

#### Credential Handling
- **Never hardcode credentials** in scripts or configuration files
- Use PowerShell credential objects or secure credential storage
- Consider using service accounts with minimal required permissions
- Implement credential rotation policies

#### Network Security
- Ensure secure connections to vCenter Server (HTTPS/SSL)
- Validate SSL certificates in production environments
- Use network segmentation to limit access to management networks
- Consider VPN or jump hosts for remote access

#### Permission Management
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Grant only necessary permissions for VM configuration changes
- Regularly audit and review assigned permissions
- Use role-based access control (RBAC) where possible

#### Logging and Monitoring
- Enable comprehensive logging for all script executions
- Monitor for unauthorized configuration changes
- Implement alerting for security-related events
- Maintain audit trails for compliance requirements

### VMware vSphere Security

#### VM Hardening
- The script applies CIS-recommended security settings
- Review all applied settings before production deployment
- Test hardening configurations in non-production environments
- Understand the impact of each security setting on VM functionality

#### vCenter Security
- Keep vCenter Server updated with latest security patches
- Use strong authentication mechanisms (multi-factor authentication)
- Regularly review and update vCenter security configurations
- Monitor vCenter logs for suspicious activities

## Security Best Practices

### Development
- Run PSScriptAnalyzer to identify potential security issues
- Follow secure coding practices for PowerShell
- Validate all input parameters
- Implement proper error handling to prevent information disclosure

### Deployment
- Use code signing for PowerShell scripts in production
- Implement execution policy restrictions
- Use constrained PowerShell environments where appropriate
- Regularly update PowerCLI and PowerShell to latest versions

### Operations
- Implement change management processes for security configurations
- Maintain backups of VM configurations before applying changes
- Test rollback procedures regularly
- Document all security-related changes

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private Disclosure**: Security issues are initially reported privately
2. **Investigation**: We investigate and develop fixes for confirmed vulnerabilities
3. **Coordinated Release**: Security fixes are released with appropriate notifications
4. **Public Disclosure**: Details are made public after fixes are available and deployed
